# DNS Spoof 
## based on the built-in payload

## What
The original DNS spoof payload with a couple of really minor tweaks

## Why
For a demo at [Kids' SecuriDay](https://securiday.com).

## What's changed
Not much. Adjusted LED colour change order so that it doesn't indicate an active attack until it's fully set up, and the button syncs the filesystem and halts the packet squirrel.
